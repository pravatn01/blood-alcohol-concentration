<!-- ## BAC Calculation Formula
The BAC is calculated using the Widmark formula:

BAC = (Alcohol Consumed (grams) * 5.14) / (Weight (lbs) * Gender Constant) - 0.015 * Time Elapsed (hours)
Where:
- **Alcohol Consumed** is the total amount of alcohol consumed in grams.
- **Gender Constant** is 0.73 for males and 0.66 for females. -->
